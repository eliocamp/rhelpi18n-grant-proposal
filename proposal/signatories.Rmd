# Signatories

<!-- 
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on popularity but community acceptance is important.  Willingness to accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery. 

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R are proposed.
