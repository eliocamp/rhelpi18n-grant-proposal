English is currently the de-facto international language and this is reflected in R function and variable names (the `mean()` function is not called `promedio()` or `Mittelwert()`) and documentation language.
And while contributed packages have a "Language" field and can be documented in other languages, the vast majority of contributed packages are documented in English.

There is [a small number of packages documented in other languages](https://cderv.rbind.io/2018/03/11/non-english-pkg-in-cran/), presumably in accordance to their target audience.
For example, [labstatR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labstatR/index.html) is a companion package for the Italian book Laboratorio Di Statistica Con R and is documented in Italian.
The [chilemapas](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chilemapas/chilemapas.pdf) package provides various simplified maps for Chile and it's documentation and function names are in Spanish.

These packages can be more accessible for their intended audience, but they are much less accessible to the wider community.
Useful functions/algorithms implemented in those packages would be hard to use for the rest of the community.
So package authors face the decision of either making their package inaccessible to their target demographic or being isolated from the wider ecosystem.

Real cases of this issue exists.
For example, the [utilsIPEA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/utilsIPEA/index.html) package, which implements functions used by the Brazilian Instituto de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada, is documented in English and its functions names are a mix of English and Portuguese.
The author publicly expressed [the need for bilingual documentation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37288823/bilingual-english-and-portuguese-documentation-in-an-r-package):

> I am writing a package to facilitate importing Brazilian socio-economic microdata sets (Census, PNAD, etc).
> I foresee two distinct groups of users of the package:
>
> -   Users in Brazil, who may feel more at ease with the documentation in Portuguese.
>     The probably can understand English to some extent, but a foreign language would probably make the package feel less "ergonomic".
>
> -   The broader international users community, from whom English documentation may be a necessary condition.
>
> Is it possible to write a package in a way that the documentation is "bilingual" (English and Portuguese), and that the language shown to the user will depend on their country/language settings?

Moreover, CRAN hosts at least two packages that have a secondary package version with documentation in another language.
The [ExpDes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ExpDes/index.html) package has the companion package [ExpDes.pt](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ExpDes.pt/index.html) with documentation in Portuguese.
Similarly, the [orloca](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/orloca/index.html) package is documented in Spanish in the [orloca.es](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/orloca.es/index.html) package.

Needless to say, this method of bilingual documentation is not recommended, as it's very hard to maintain and doesn't scale to other languages.
A better alternative would be for R to allow packages to have multilingual documentation.
