# Project plan

## Start-up phase

```{=html}
<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.

 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->
```
Before starting the project proper we will consult on the R help system internals, .Rd parsing, and .pot creation and translation.
Depending on scheduling with the people involved, this could take around 2 weeks.

## Technical delivery

```{=html}
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->
```
Target date is realtive to after the start-up phase.

| Delivery                                     | Hours | Target date |
|----------------------------------------------|-------|-------------|
| .Rd parsing.                                 | 25    | 2 weeks     |
| Creation of .pot files                       | 10    | 3 weeks     |
| Translation of .Rd files using .po files     | 10    | 4 weeks     |
| Installation of translation modules          | 30    | 6 weeks     |
| Rendering of help pages in selected language | 30    | 8 weeks     |

## Other aspects

```{=html}
<!--
Covering non-technical activities like on-going publicity, paper preparation, discussion groups etc. that might be required to facilitate successful delivery of the project.

 - [ ] Announcement post
 - [ ] Delivery blog post
 - [ ] Twitter
 - [ ] UseR!
 - [ ] ISC meetings
-->
```
We will promote the work via blogposts in the [R-Hub blog](https://blog.r-hub.io/) during development and announce the package when it's done.
16 hours in total.

We will also write an article for [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/) or [The R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/) 20 hours.
